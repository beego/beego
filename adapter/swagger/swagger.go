// Swaggerâ„¢ is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.
//
// The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.
// Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.
