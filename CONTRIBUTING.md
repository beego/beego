# Contributing to beego

beego is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Here are instructions to get you started. They are probably not perfect, 
please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Contribution guidelines

### Pull requests

First of all. beego follow the gitflow. So please send you pull request 
to **develop** branch. We will close the pull request to master branch.

We are always happy to receive pull requests, and do our best to
review them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be
discouraged! Sometimes we can make a mistake, please do more explaining 
for us. We will appreciate it.

We're trying very hard to keep beego simple and fast. We don't want it
to do everything for everybody. This means that we might decide against
incorporating a new feature. But we will give you some advice on how to 
do it in other way.

### Create issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/astaxie/beego/issues) before anybody
starts working on it. 

Also when filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

- What version of beego are you using (bee version)?
- What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

### but check existing issues and docs first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist
documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it
never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will
help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

Also if you don't know how to use it. please make sure you have read though
the docs in http://beego.me/docs
